# unzipfx

unzipfx.exe is a file associated with a program called "UnzipFX," which is a file decompression utility that allows you to extract files from ZIP archives. UnzipFX is a self-extracting ZIP SFX (SFX stands for "self-extracting archive"), which means that it includes the necessary extraction program as part of the archive. This allows users to extract the files from the archive by simply double-clicking on the unzipfx.exe file, without needing to install a separate file decompression utility.


Put "unzipsfx.exe", which in the folders in this repo, into the same folder as where the "sample.zip" is found. Then, in the folder where "unzipsfx.exe" and "jre.zip" are found, run this:


To use this on windows open CMD and use this command:
`copy /B unzipsfx.exe + sample.zip self-extracting-archive.exe`

Overall, unzipfx.exe is a useful tool for distributing and extracting files from ZIP archives, especially when it is not practical or convenient for users to install a separate file decompression utility.
